Quick Guide for Python Programming from a Java Perspective

Basics:

- Python Reserve Words and Identifiers:
and     assert    break     class     continue
def     del       elif      else      except
exec    finally   for       from      global
if      import    in        is        lambda
not     or        pass      print     raise
return  try       while 

float
int
string

- If a statment is too long to fit on a single line, however, you can use a backslash (\) at the end of the line and continue the statement onto the next line.

	result = (someValue * 5 + anotherValue * 12) \
         - (originalValue * 2)

- Primitive Types:
    Numeric: integer, long integer, floating-point, complex (real and imaginary parts)
    Boolean: True, False
    Strings: "xxxxx"
    Sequences: 
    	list (array) --> [0,1,2,3]
    	tuple (final list) --> 1,2,3 OR (1,2,3)
    Collections:
    	dictionary (hash) --> {123 : "hey", 456 : "sup"}
    	set (unordered collection of immutable values)
