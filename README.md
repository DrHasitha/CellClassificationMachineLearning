Final Project

Description (3/13/16):
	This program classifies single cell types from RNA-seq data in mice. Our approach is to use supervised machine learning algorithms on a single cell RNA-seq dataset with a 80% marked (training) and 20% unmarked (testing) partition. We use 5 machine learning algorithms with the hopes of determining the best supervised learning algorithm to classify unmarked cells. This project 

Technical Notes:
	This project is written in Python using version 2.7. All machine learning algorithms are from the scikit-learn library which uses SciPy, NumPy and matplotlib to implement data mining and data analysis tools. Preprocessing of data is also implemented using scikit
